# Dark Tael Theme

Hello! It's the second time that I make an extension for vscode. I decided to do this because although there are very good themes I never like the color of the typography, that's why I made the theme **Dark-Teal-Theme** thought to be used with languages like html, css, js, go, cpp & java.

For the background, I was inspired by the [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) extension & the [Bearded Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BeardedBear.beardedtheme) Black & Diamond extension

For the color of the typography, most of them I create from scratch. But for html, I was inspired by the [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework homepage. And for java, I was inspired by the [ayu](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dempfi.ayu-vs) Ayu Dark extension

## JetBrains Mono

JetBrains Mono font is my favorite for my vscode. I really like it when I'm developing my codes. So if you want you can download it from its official page [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

To use JetBrains Mono font in vscode, you just need to download the file from the official site, then install it on your computer and finally add the following line in your vscode settings:

```sh
# settings.json file
{
   "editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
   "editor.fontWeight" : "400", 
   # ^ this is the weight of my favorite font
}
```
